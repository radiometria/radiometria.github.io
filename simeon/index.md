## About SimEON

SimEON is capable of foresee the operational status of elastic optical networks, what constitutes an important information to their project, both in monetary and in operational aspects.

In its latest version, the physical impairments considered by SimEON are:

* ASE (_Amplified Spontaneous Emission_) Noise due to EDFA (_Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers_) Fibers
* Filter Imperfection
* Attenuation in the Optical Fiber
* Losses in Optical Devices

In relation to routing algorithms, SimEON is currently capable of using the following ones:

* _Minimum Hops_ (MH)
* _Shortest Path_ (SP)
* _Length and Occupation Routing_ (LOR)
* _Power Series Routing_ (PSR)

In relation to spectrum assignment algorithms, SimEON is currently capable of using the following ones:

* _First Fit_ (FF) 
* _Exact Fit_ (EF)
* _Random Fit_ (RF)
* _Best Fit_ (BF)
* _Most Used_ (MU)
* _Least Used_ (LU)

It is a powerful tool in the area of elastic optical networks. It can work as basis to the development of routing, spectrum assignment, regenerator assignment and regenerator placement algorithms, and to analyze the impact of several parameters over the network's performance.
