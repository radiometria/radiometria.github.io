## About SSON

SSON is capable of foresee the operational status of elastic optical networks, what constitutes an important information to their project, both in monetary and in operational aspects.

In its latest version, the physical impairments considered by SSON are:

* ASE (_Amplified Spontaneous Emission_) Noise due to EDFA (_Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers_) Fibers
* Attenuation in the Optical Fiber
* Losses in Optical Devices

About routing algorithms, SSON is capable of using the following ones:

* _Minimum Hops_ (MH)
* _Shortest Path_ (SP)
* _Length and Occupation Routing_ (LOR)
* _Power Series Routing_ (PSR)

SSON is available in English, French and [Portuguese](pt/).

It is a powerful tool in the area of elastic optical networks. It can work as basis to the development of routing, spectrum assignment, regenerator assignment and regenerator placement algorithms, and to analyze the impact of several parameters over the network's performance.

## Obtaining SSON

Nowadays, SSON has versions to 32 and 64 Bits systems, based in Linux, both _apt_ based (as Ubuntu, or Debian) and _rpm_ based (as Fedora, or Red Hat).

Its latest version can be found here.
